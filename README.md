A recruitment website for the Lanarkshire branch of the Retired Police Officers Association of Scotland.

The business goals of this website are:
* Build awareness of the RPOAS amongst retired police officers.
* Promote the benefits of RPOAS membership.
* Encourage engagement in the RPOAS community.
* Rekindle a sense of pride and belonging in the police community.

The user goals of this website are:

### Improving The User Experience

#### Finding out what the RPOAS can offer
Prior to the creation of this website, the methods of communication with RPOAS members and potential members were:
* [RPOAS Lanarkshire Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/rpoas.lanarkshire), which is only accessible to those with a Facebook account. 
* Mass emails, which the RPOAS Lanarkshire branch sends using [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/). The mailing list consists of RPOAS Lanarkshire members and potential members who have provided their contact details at recruitment events.
* A central [RPOAS website](https://www.rpoas.org.uk/wp/), with separate pages for each branch. This site is maintained centrally and rarely updated. Most information is only available with login details.

This RPOAS Lanarkshire website compliments and improves upon these existing methods of communication by providing an easily 
accessible source of information that is not reliant on users having a Facebook account or having already volunteered their 
contact details. It is directly operated by the RPOAS Lanarkshire Branch, who can ensure that information remains current and regularly updated.
