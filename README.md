</div>

A recruitment website for the Lanarkshire branch of the Retired Police Officers Association of Scotland. 
The primary goal is to encourage retired police officers to join and engage with the RPOAS.

of historical photos.

to the police force in Lanarkshire, details of member benefits, a sign up form and a contact page.

The business goals of this website are:
* Build awareness of the RPOAS amongst retired police officers.
* Promote the benefits of RPOAS membership.
* Encourage engagement in the RPOAS community.
* Rekindle a sense of pride and belonging in the police community.

The user goals of this website are:

* An intuitive sign up process.
* Easy access to the rest of the RPOAS community.
* A simple way to search through historical photos.

## User Experience

### Target Audience

The target audience for RPOAS Lanarkshire are:
* Retired police officers.
* Likely to have spent at least some of their career in Lanarkshire (but not a requirement for membership).
* Likely to live in Scotland (but not a requirement for membership).
* Aged between 50 to 90 years old.
* Not necessarily very experienced with navigating the internet.

A secondary audience are family and friends of retired police officers, particularly those who have passed away.
The RPOAS provides a way for family/friends to stay connected with the police community and reminisce about their 
loved ones.

### User Journey

There are several possible user journeys to the website:
* Recently attended a retirement seminar, where RPOAS Lanarkshire has given a presentation.
* Recently retired and been emailed/posted information about RPOAS Lanarkshire.
* Visited the RPOAS Lanarkshire Facebook page.
* Been referred by a current RPOAS member.
* Used a search engine.
* Current RPOAS members who have been informed about the website by email or Facebook.

### User Aim

Users visit this website because they want:
* To find out about what the RPOAS can offer members.
* A quick and easy way to register as an RPOAS member.
* To discover what events are upcoming in their area.
* An easily searchable way to look through the historical photos.
* To contact the RPOAS branch with a question or suggestion.
* To contribute to the collection of historical photos.

### Improving The User Experience

#### Finding out what the RPOAS can offer
Prior to the creation of this website, the methods of communication with RPOAS members and potential members were:
* [RPOAS Lanarkshire Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/rpoas.lanarkshire), which is only accessible to those with a Facebook account. 
* Mass emails, which the RPOAS Lanarkshire branch sends using [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/). The mailing list consists of RPOAS Lanarkshire members and potential members who have provided their contact details at recruitment events.
* A central [RPOAS website](https://www.rpoas.org.uk/wp/), with separate pages for each branch. This site is maintained centrally and rarely updated. Most information is only available with login details.

This RPOAS Lanarkshire website compliments and improves upon these existing methods of communication by providing an easily 
accessible source of information that is not reliant on users having a Facebook account or having already volunteered their 
contact details. It is directly operated by the RPOAS Lanarkshire Branch, who can ensure that information remains current and regularly updated.

#### Registering as an RPOAS member
Prior to this website, members registered by contacting the RPOAS Branch by phone, email, Facebook or in person to request a registration form. A word doc was emailed to the individual to complete and then emailed back to the RPOAS Branch. 
The member details were then manually copied to a spreadsheet and email details were manually copied to the Branch's Mailchimp account. 

This RPOAS Lanarkshire website provides a much more efficient and accessible way to register as a member. The registration form automatically adds members' details to the Mailchimp mailing list and the membership database (also 
stored on the Branch's Mailchimp account).

# MY NOTES/REMINDERS. NOT PART OF FINAL README

## Milestone Project 2 

Project purpose: Presentation of interactive data
In this project, you'll build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, 
allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

Value provided:
Users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their personal goals and derive answers to their specific questions.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves.

Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

1. Dynamic Front End Project: Write custom JavaScript, HTML and CSS code to create a front-end web application consisting of one or more HTML pages with significant interactive functionality.
2. Site Responses: Use JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions.
3. Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu (unless irrelevant) and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
4. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
5. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
6. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
7. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
