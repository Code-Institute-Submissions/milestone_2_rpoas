# Retired Police Officers Association Lanarkshire

[Open in GitHub](https://github.com/H4RP3RK/milestone_2_rpoas)

</div>

A recruitment website for the Lanarkshire branch of the Retired Police Officers Association of Scotland. 
The primary goal is to encourage retired police officers to join and engage with the RPOAS. 
It is also to keep current members informed about branch news and events, and to continue to build on the collection 
of historical photos. 

The website features member testimonials, details of past and upcoming events, a gallery of historical photos related
to the police force in Lanarkshire, details of member benefits, a sign up form and a contact page.

The client requested this website to address a number of issues with current methods of recruitment and communication. 
* [RPOAS Lanarkshire Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/rpoas.lanarkshire), which is only accessible to those with a Facebook account. 
* Mass emails, which the RPOAS Lanarkshire branch sends using [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/). The mailing list consists of RPOAS Lanarkshire members and potential members who have provided their contact details at recruitment events.
* A central [RPOAS website](https://www.rpoas.org.uk/wp/), with separate pages for each branch. This site is maintained centrally and rarely updated. Most information is only available with login details.

The business goals of this website are to:
* Build awareness of the RPOAS amongst retired police officers.
* Promote the benefits of RPOAS membership.
* Encourage engagement in the RPOAS community.
* Rekindle a sense of pride and belonging in the police community.

The user goals of this website are:
* To find out more about what the RPOAS is and what it offers to members.
* An intuitive sign up process.
* Easy access to the rest of the RPOAS community.
* A simple way to search through historical photos.

## Features

Every page has a consistent layout and design, which features:
* Headers and footers coloured blue and off-white, in line with the Police Scotland brand. The gold accents are in keeping with the RPOAS logo.
* The RPOAS logo takes pride of place in the centre of the header, drawing the visitor's attention.
* The responsive navigation bar is also placed centre, directly underneath the logo. The active navigation link is highlighted in gold. On mobile screens, the navigation bar is reduced to a burger in order to utilise screen space.
* The footer features links to related sites - the RPOAS central website, the RPOAS Lanarkshire Facebook page, an internal link to the contact page and the Lanarkshire Police Historical Society.
* A banner provides a clear call to action for visitors to join the RPOAS. It provides a link to the signup page, which is highlighted with the banner's gold colour and finger point symbols.
* Consistent and simple styling of the gold rounded-border boxes breaks each web page's information into easily digestible chunks. 

#### About 
Welcomes the visitor with a photo of the RPOAS Lanarkshire Committee. The [thin blue line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_blue_line) across the photograph invokes the police force symbolism. An explanation is provided as to the target audience and what the RPOAS provides. Links are provided to each of the features of the website and also to the RPOAS 
Lanarkshire Facebook page. These links are highlighted with the finger point symbols. 

The responsive grid design shows one column in smaller screens and two columns in larger screens.

#### Signup 
Provides a simple form, broken down into three clear sections. Required sections are denoted with an asterix. The banner reiterates the reasons for signing up, which have previously been explained to the user on the about page.
The large submit button draws the user's attention. On pressing submission, a clear explanation is given on whether the submission was successful or required sections are missing. If successful, the user is informed that an email with further details will be sent to them shortly.
The thumbs up symbol continues the imagery used in the banner and elsewhere on the website.

The responsive grid design increases the size of the form as the screen size increases. Some input sections are moved onto the one line on larger screens.

#### Gallery 
A simple search form is presented at the top of the screen. Each search input provides clear and concise instructions on the way in which the photos can be searched. The search form invites the user to click on each picture for more information and the hover styling on each photo highlights that they can be clicked. 
On clicking each photo, a large modal appears with a larger full dimension version of the photo, a heading that includes the year the photo was taken, a paragraph explaining the history of the photo and a footer that invites the user to get in touch if they have any further information on the photo.

The responsive grid design presents one column of full width and length photos on smaller screens. On medium size screens, a photos are shown in a three-column grid of equal width and height. On larger screens, this increases to a five-column grid. The rounded-border styling of the photos on medium and large screens envokes a nostalgic feeling. 

#### Events 
A Google Map with clear instructions on how the markers can be used to search for events. As each marker is clicked, the relevant event rises to the top of the list and expands to present more information and instructions on how to sign up to the event.

The responsive grid design presents as one single column in smaller screens and two columns in larger screens.

#### Contact 
A concise form with a clear invitation to get in touch. The text input section provides further suggestions as to what the visitor may wish to get in touch about. Consistent with the signup page, the asterix denotes the required sections. A friendly message, that references the visitor's name, appears when the email has been successfully sent. The thumbs up symbol is inkeeping with the rest of the website.

### Existing Features

* Header Logo - on every page. Acts as a navigation link back to the About page.
* Navigation bar - on every page. Allows users to easily identify the website pages and navigate to the area of their choosing.
* Banner - on every page. Call to action for visitors to join the RPOAS and an easily accessible way to navigate to the signup page.
* Footer links - on every page. Identifies related sites and provides accessible links to each.
* Sign Up Form - an embedded MailChimp form that automatically sends the user's information to the RPOAS Lanarkshire's existing MailChimp account. Those who sign up are automatically added to the mailing list and their details are stored on a database.
* Gallery - allows users to browse through photos, filter by location and/or year and order by year. By clicking on each photo, a modal provides a larger version of the photo with further information about its history. Visitors are invited to get in touch with more info.
* Events - users can either browse through events list or search for an event in a specific area using the Google Maps API. Each event is represented by an accordian that can be expanded to show further information and details on how to sign up.
* Contact - an Emailjs API is used to link with the RPOAS Lanarkshire email account. Users can easily email the RPOAS with any questions, suggestions or information they may have.

### Features Left to Implement

* A news section that provides updates on policing and pension matters. This was not seen as relevant to this milestone project as interactivity would be minimal.
* Link the events page with an API, such as Event Brite. This would allow members to sign up and pay for events in advance. Would require RPOAS Lanarkshire to sign up for an EventBrite account.
* Add a file upload option to the contact page, which would allow members to send in photos to add to the gallery. This option was explored but is only available through subscription to Emailjs.

Value provided:
Users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their personal goals and derive answers to their specific questions.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves.

Mandatory Requirements
